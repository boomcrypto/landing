      <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        Founded in 2024, Boom emerged from a vision to transform how people interact with Bitcoin and digital assets. We recognized that while cryptocurrency adoption was growing, the experience remained fragmented and often isolating. Our solution: create a platform that combines the security of Bitcoin with the power of social connection.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Today, Boom is pioneering the integration of Bitcoin, Layer 2 solutions, and social features to create a more connected and accessible crypto ecosystem. Our platform brings together digital asset management, community engagement, and marketplace functionality in one seamless experience.
